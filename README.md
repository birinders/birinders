### If you're reading this, you've (hopefully) reached the profile you're looking for. 
### My name is Birinder, and I'm a Computer Engineering student at TIET, Patiala. 
### Since you're here anyways, let me show you around.-->

I am currently a final year student at Thapar Institute of Engg. and Technology at Patiala, India, and am pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Engineering.
I am (fingers crossed) set on my way to graduate university in 2024. I have been around computers since as little as I can remember, and wish to be around them till so may conclude my life and times. So far, I've learnt two things during my time at college- 
1. Strings are the hardest topic there ever will be, and
2. My love for the VSCode debugger is nigh unprecedented. (that thing has a stronger addiction than most addicting things I know)<br>The only thing that maybe holds a candle to it is the Windows Terminal itself.

I'm worked with Python and C++, but am especially adept with the former. I have focused my electives on Accelerated Computing and Machine Learning using libraries like Numba, CUDA C++, TensorFlow, CuML, CuDF, etc.
I am also experienced in the field of Computer Vision, and have worked extensively with OpenCV, one of the most prominent computer vision libraries for both Python and C++.

Since you've read this far, let me introduce you to

## The projects-

### Almost all of my projects stem from a singular idea-

*Libraries are great tools, but not strong enough representations of your own knowledge of the subject.*

After all, there's some difference between a doctor and a chemist. You may rely on either for small ailments, but only a doctor truly knows the ins and outs of everything to back his judgement.

That is why my major projects rely on discarding the use of libraries in the favour of a more hands-on approach.
And the best way of doing it is by using the least provided to you, the ‚ú®terminal‚ú®.
Countless projects of mine revolve around harnessing the power of this most basic tool available to us, like-

While this is a bare glimpse of my creations (and my face), I wish to show you what's possible without ever using any external dependencies through some of my work. I believe that while the grandeur of large libraries and models is quite intriguing, we must approach any problem at its roots, to find ourselves in the shoes of those who first *created* these aids in order to help us out. I know there's no need to reinvent the wheel, but you better know how to make one in case you find yourself stranded in the middle of nowhere. (remember that the next time you ask your local chemist to prescribe you medicine).

#### üõ†Ô∏è I'm currently working on a Machine Learning Engine built from scratch in Python. A C++ port is under consideration for the future.

- Since Machine Learning has been at the core of my interests in this field, this was the most natural next step for me. To build a Neural Network Engine from scratch, and to delve into the nitty gritties of this mysterious, yet unfathomably powerful subject. I've decided to first work on the Python version in order to get a quicker development cycle in tradeoff for slower runtime speeds. Once the implementation is set, I can start work with its more performance centric version in C++.
<br></br>

On this singular core principal, I've created everything this page has to offer.
What lies within each of my projects is up on display on their respective repositories, and is yours to see and find out.

Well, see you there I guess?
