### ðŸ‘‹ Hello There!
### If you're reading this, you've \*_maybe_\* reached the right profile.
### My name is Birinder, and I'm a Computer Engineering student at TIET, Patiala. 
### Since you're here, let me show you around.

I am currently a final year student at Thapar Institute of Engg. and Technology at Patiala, India, and am pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Engineering.
I am (fingers crossed) set on my way to graduate university in 2024. I have been around computers since as little as I can remember, and wish to be around them, till so may conclude my life and times. I've learnt two things during my time at college- 1. Strings are the hardest topic there will ever be, and 2. My love for the VSCode debugger is nigh unprecedented. (fr though, that thing has a stronger addiction than most addicting things I know). The only thing that maybe holds a candle to it is the Windows Termminal itself.

- I'm currently working on a Machine Learning Engine built from scratch in Python. A C++ port is under consideration for the future.

#### Almost all of my projects stem from a singular idea-

*Libraries are great tools, but not strong enough representations of your own knowledge of the subject.*

After all, there's some difference between a doctor and a chemist. You may rely on either for small ailments, but only a doctor truly knows the ins and outs of everything to back his judgement.

That is why my major projects rely on discarding the use of libraries in the favour of a more hands-on approach.
And the best way of doing it is by using the least provided to you, the âœ¨terminalâœ¨.

  âœ¨The Windows Terminalâœ¨

Countless projects of mine revolve around harnessing the power of this most basic tool available to us, like-
